An associated blog post can be found [here](http://www.jayway.com/2015/03/04/using-react-with-ecmascript-6/), though it may be outdated compared to this repository.

The gist of it is this:

* Using [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), traverse the dependency tree.
* With the help of [babel](https://babeljs.io/), transpile any occurences of ECMAScript 6 syntax.
* Output the result to the `build` directory and serve it.
